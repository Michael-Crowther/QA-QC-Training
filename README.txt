This React and Typescript application was created as a training manual for Wyssling Consulting.
The pages are setup in a grid-like fashion. The pages can be found within the 'src'
folder. To run the app, you will need to download several dependencies. Check out the
package.json file for more details.

Start the server in one terminal by running "node server.cjs" which is the file 
that uses node.js and node express to communicate with the client and setup the 
APIs used for logging in, logging out, accessing user information, and submitting
forms to a google doc using the googledocs api.

Run "npm start" in a seperate terminal to start the app.
